# An Automated Budget Decision Engine for Marketing Spend Under Uncertainty

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern marketing organizations still make budget allocation decisions using a mix of heuristics, dashboards, and analyst judgment.
Metrics such as ROAS are noisy, unstable, and poorly suited for scaling decisions under uncertainty.

Most existing tools optimize reporting, not decisions.
As a result, teams struggle with:
- knowing when to scale versus hold
- handling small or noisy datasets
- transferring learnings across accounts
- avoiding false confidence

This system is designed to directly address these gaps.

## 2. What This System Does

This system produces channel-level budget recommendations (increase, monitor, reduce) by:

- learning nonlinear spend–response relationships
- simulating counterfactual spend changes
- explicitly modeling uncertainty
- incorporating delayed (lagged) effects
- pooling knowledge across datasets

The primary output is decisions, not dashboards.
